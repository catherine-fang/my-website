    <h1>About Catherine</h1>
    <p>I attend Carnegie Vanguard High School and will become a senior in the fall. Since I will be applying for colleges soon, I need to start deciding which majors I am, or am not, interested in. Thus, I applied for the 7-week-long summer immersion program for Girls Who Code, and I got in!</p>
    <p>I enjoy watching Netflix in my free time, much like many other teenagers in this generation, but also volunteering. I am currently a Student Hero at Houston Food Bank, which means that I dedicate at least 50 hours towards “helping fight hunger” for each semester (semesters are approximately 4 months long), and I also help out with Houston Chinese Church Children’s Ministry by teaching children Sunday School and looking over infants.</p>
    <p>I also love to exercise and explore new restaurants with my friends; we often have “lunch dates” and spend 1-2 hours burning off those calories afterwards.</p>

    <p>When I grow up, I would like to travel to many places, such as Greece and Italy. </p>
